# Number Guesser

#### This is a project off of Codecademy's front end career path


# **Project Goals**
In this project, you’ll write JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game. Your code will run in the browser instead of just the terminal, but you have an output section to help you test your functions and show you if you have syntax errors.

# **Setup Instructions**
You’ll need to open and work in script.js in a text editor, and open index.html in a browser to test your code.
